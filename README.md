# Forecasting Happiness
This is a data science project where we analysed the World Happiness Report 2018. We used the values of happiness & its supporting factors from 2005 to 2016, predict the happiness values in 2017. This is a school project I did for my CZ1015 Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence module in NTU. My group mates are Shivani and Yiting. 

## Data
- The data comes from [World Happiness Report 2018](https://s3.amazonaws.com/happiness-report/2018/WHR2018Chapter2OnlineData.xls) and [Population Data from World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?view=chart)
- The cleaned dataset is in the `happiness.csv` file.

## How to Run
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Open `ForecastingHappiness.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
